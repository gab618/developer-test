Instructions

- Technology and frameworks allowed in this test: raw JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, EJS template engine, HTML/HTML5.
  No database allowed. No Angular or any other JavaScript framework allowed. You might use node.js and raw
  Express if you like.

- Functionality

  - Using EJS as a template engine, create a web page as follows in page 3 (you may create as many EJS files you
    consider necessary).
  - OBJ1 has one button ”Option”. Clicking this button will show OBJ2 shown on page 4 (use a sliding effect to
    display the whole OBJ2).
  - Create a dropdown as shown in page 4 inside OBJ2 and add 2 options (A and B). As the user chooses A,
    update OBJ3 listing items (A1, A2, A3…). If the user chooses B, update to B1, B2, B3…
  - The number of items to show in OBJ3 will be determined by the ”quantity” field on OBJ1. If the user chooses
    the dropdown option without typing the quantity, no items should be shown and the ”quantity” field should
    be highlighted in red to be filled out.
  - Make the Pagination works when clicking the arrows (limit 3 items per page).
  - If the user clicks outside the OBJ2, OBJ2 should fade out (disappear).

- Delivery: Please commit your code, push to your Git repo and send us your Git URL. Optionally as a complement,
  you may also upload the demo to your server (if you have one), and send us the link. Do not send us the files.
